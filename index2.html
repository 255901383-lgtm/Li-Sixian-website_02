  <h1>Li Sixian, How Not to Be Heard: A Survival Manual for Sound in the Digital Age, 2025</h1>
  <p>This film is inspired by Hito Steyerl's How Not to Be Seen: A Fucking Didactic Educational .MOV File (2013), and uses performance, green screen keying, and animation to explore the contemporary condition of sound in the digital age — particularly the tension between voice, data, and surveillance.</p>
  <p>Be careful — you might already be overheard. </p>
  <p>Do we still live in a world of real sound, or one of digitally replicated audio? </p>
  <p>What happens when voices are cloned — is it still your voice, or someone else's property? </p>
  <p>Can you still say your words represent you? </p>
  <p>Are our digital doubles gradually replacing us? </p>
  <p>Perhaps this Survival Manual for Sound will help you avoid being heard — or help you realize how impossible that already is. </p>
