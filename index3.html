  <h1>Li Sixian, Silence, 2025</h1>
  <p>Silence is not neutral, but is a form of non-verbal violence that diminishes the
presence of the other. Silence leads to a lack of response, it pricks the
self-identity of the interlocutor, creating misunderstanding, shame and unease. We uneasily ask ourselves: am I doing something wrong? Do I not deserve a
response? We are anxious in silence because our existence is never done
independently. We identify ourselves in our responses, so that in the moment
of pause in the dialogue, the "I" seems to start to blur.</p>
  <p>This work is a sound experiment, using Musique concr√®te techniques, combining real-life recordings with digital processing to construct a
soundscape eroded by silence. Silence here is not a soundless sound, but a
neglected sound, a fractured breath, a suppressed tone, an unspoken word.</p>
  <p>I hope that the audience can appreciate the weight of silence from "listening", and realise that silence is not just stillness, but the control of flow, a power that
is often overlooked by us.</p>
